#README FOR THIS PROJECT
This is currently going to be a list of all parts for Beyblade Burst and an API to go with it.

#INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROJECT

#SET UP

#CHANGE HISTORY
* Home page added. It's very bare bones but I want the site to get started.
* Need to set up a way to test the API end points.
* Need serializers for the Part Model and the Combination Model.

#TO-DO
* The Combination Model needs an overhaul from the admin panel side. When creating a new combination parts of all types come up for every specific part field. When creating a form to create combinations I can probably specify to only show specific types of parts in each drop down input.
* The Combination Model can't handle Gachinko layer combinations. This can be addressed once all other aspects of it are completed.
* There is no dual layer option for the Part Model in the Spin Direction Field. This needs to be added.
